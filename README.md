# Vhere's Valdo

## How to Play

You start with 30 seconds to click/tap the stick figure (or Valdo) that matches the one shown above the timer bar.

You get 1 point and 2 additional seconds for each correct guess. You lose 5 seconds for each incorrect guess.

Each correct guess adds 2 more Valdos to the collection below.

## Behind the Scenes

Each Valdo is a programmatically defined SVG based on a given first and last name.

First name determines the color and type of shirt worn and last name determines the color and length of pants/dress.

I plan to add features to be able to see and interact with the 'found Valdos' after each round, but I haven't had the time as of yet.

I've also laid the foundation to be able to add hats, glasses, scarves, or change the hand/foot locations for each Valdo. That's another feature I'd like to add in the future.
